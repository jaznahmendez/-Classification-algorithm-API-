# Classification algorithm API
## Overview  
This project implements a classification algorithm designed to categorize new information added to a database or classify objects into predefined groups. The algorithm determines whether incoming data represents a new object or matches an existing object in the database.  

## Features  
- **Nearest Neighbor Algorithm**: Classifies data points based on proximity to existing entries.  
- **Multiple Distance Measurement Methods**:  
  - Euclidean Distance  
  - Manhattan Distance  
  - Chebyshev Distance  
- **Excel File Editing**: Easily process `.xls` files for data input and output.  
- **Future-Ready Expandable API**: Built for flexibility and future integration of additional algorithms.  

## Who Can Benefit  
- **Users** managing and classifying large volumes of information.  
- **Programmers** expanding the list of available classification algorithms.
